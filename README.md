# Robust Railway Timetable Rescheduling Tool

This repository provides a framework for **railway timetable rescheduling** under disruptions.
It integrates exact and heuristic optimization methods to generate feasible, high-quality rescheduling plans, aiming to minimize passenger inconvenience, deviations from the reference timetable, and operational costs.

**This project is integrated with the industrial tool Viriato through the SMA algorithmic platform. Infrastructure data, planned train schedules, conflicts, and disruption scenarios are extracted from Viriato. The tool also takes as input passenger demand data in the form of an origin–destination matrix. The optimization module generates one or several disposition timetables, which can then be sent back to Viriato for visualization and further validation.**

Integration with the SMA algorithmic platform is achieved via the open source Python client: [openviriato.algorithm-platform.py-client](https://github.com/sma-software/openviriato.algorithm-platform.py-client.git).

## 🚄 Overview

Railway operations are highly sensitive to disruptions (e.g., infrastructure failures).
This project provides algorithms and tools to **repair** an existing timetable after such disruptions using a **multi-objective optimization** framework.

The project implements:
- A **Gurobi-based exact approach** for small instances.
- A **heuristic** approach (Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search).
- Integration with the industrial tool **Viriato** for data gathering, visualization, and feasibility validation.
